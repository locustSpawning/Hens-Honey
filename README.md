# Hens-Honey

Real World Project ~ redesigning a local small business website. Focusing on connecting all their HTML pages into one cohesive website while improving on their communication to users

# Purpose

Hens and Honey Shoppe is a local boutique and coffee brewery. While their businesses are trendy and appeal to customers of today, their website is significantly lacking in up to date expectations. They have many HTML pages which are not linked to one another, their information architecture is below average, and their current website has the intention of style which falls short to today's standards.

My goal is to restructure thier website so that the information architecture is significantly better while also bringing forth the Hens & Honey style.
